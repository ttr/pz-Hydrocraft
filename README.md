# HC
* My take on Hydrocraft in PZ 41
* Not on Workshop, do not upload
* use ttrs branch - master branch is synced to workshop version of robot ex140 / Hasis (which ever is up to date)
* Maintainers of other HC versions - feel free to re-use it but better will be if we do consolidate this into one maintained mod.

# Notes.
## see Todo for what is planned (rough ideas)
## occasionally maintained
## Changed:
* removed solar stuff (not fully) - use ISA mod for this
* removed rammen items - use Rammen Mod
* changed some polearms values to be aligned with vanilla
* changed mining to remove arrowheads/bones/trash (or limit them)

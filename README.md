# HC
* My take on Hydrocraft in PZ 41
* Not on Workshop, do not upload
* use ttrs branch - master branch is synced to workshop version of robot ex140 / Hasis (which ever is up to date)
* Maintainers of other HC versions - feel free to re-use it but better will be if we do consolidate this into one maintained mod.

# Notes.
## on ttrs branch - see Todo for what is planned (rough ideas)
## on ttrs branch - see changed.txt for changes
## occasionally maintained

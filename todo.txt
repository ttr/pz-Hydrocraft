Wpn:
remove all spear variants
rebalance all polearms one

*:
clean up solar
remove genrators from all recipes (like PC) and add energy dependence
remove steel pipes/bars as those one are in vanilla (metal bar/pipe is steel)
create drying mechanism (timed, temp/weather deended) and move skins drying from recipe to that. Add drying grass to straw before creating twine.


Boneworking:
remove zombie bones on mining and replace it with random animal bones
add ability to harvest bones from corpes (+integrate wuth corpse study mod)

Mining: 
Create geology map, possibly based on persitant game seed.
Basedo on that create some mining zones for all ores and allocate probablity based on XY of map.
Will need to have way of providing feedback (reading geology book would give notes with zones coordinates?)
As result players will need to plan mine locations.

Constructions:
migrate all constructions (like mine/smithy) from anchoring to construction, same as klin/bench.
